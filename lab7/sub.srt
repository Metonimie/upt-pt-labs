113
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,670
He's a <strong>comrade</strong>.

114
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,632
He is a <strong>soldier<strong>.

115
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:40,912
He's big in business.

495
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:03,316
I'm telling you, gents.
Informer is <b><i>this<i/></b> security guard.

496
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,294
Wait >a< second,

497
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,537
I hear what you <i>saying</i>.

498
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,798
But this whole thing is <underline>screwed</underline>.

499
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:15,636
The cops obviously know <u>everything</u>.
The job is a flop<.

500
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:20,892
I'm saying we cancel the job,
finish the cop and piss off.

501
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,978
Let him be killed!
